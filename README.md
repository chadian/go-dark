# go dark ðŸŒ• ðŸŒ– ðŸŒ— ðŸŒ˜ ðŸŒ‘
This mac application helps you focus by quickly blocking macos notifications, and on a timer if it helps. It does this by controlling the _Do Not Disturb_ setting on macos.

The name is in reference to the idea behind the _dark side of the moon_
> The word "dark" has expanded to refer also to the fact that communication with spacecraft can be blocked while the spacecraft is on the far side of the Moon, during Apollo space missions for example.
